Subject: [PATCH bpf-next v3 0/9] Implement task_local_storage

# v2 -> v3

- Added bpf_spin_locks to the selftests for local storage, found that
  these are not available for LSM programs.
- Made spin lock helpers available for LSM programs (except sleepable
  programs which need more work).
- Minor fixes for includes and added short commit messages for patches
  that were split up for libbpf and bpftool.

# v1 -> v2

- Updated the refcounting for task_struct and simplified conversion
  of fd -> struct pid.
- Some fixes suggested by Martin and Andrii, notably:
   * long return type for the bpf_task_storage_delete helper (update
     for bpf_inode_storage_delete will be sent separately).
   * Remove extra nullness check to task_storage_ptr in map syscall
     ops.
   * Changed the argument signature of the BPF helpers to use
     task_struct pointer in uapi headers.
   * Remove unnecessary verifier logic for the bpf_get_current_task_btf
     helper.
   * Split the changes for bpftool and libbpf.
- Exercised syscall operations for local storage (kept a simpler verison
  in test_local_storage.c, the eventual goal will be to update
  sk_storage_map.c for all local storage types).
- Formatting fixes + Rebase.

We already have socket and inode local storage since [1]

This patch series:

* Implements bpf_local_storage for task_struct.
* Implements the bpf_get_current_task_btf helper which returns a BTF
  pointer to the current task. Not only is this generally cleaner
  (reading from the task_struct currently requires BPF_CORE_READ), it
  also allows the BTF pointer to be used in task_local_storage helpers.
* In order to implement this helper, a RET_PTR_TO_BTF_ID is introduced
  which works similar to RET_PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL but does not require
  a nullness check.
* Implements a detection in selftests which uses the
  task local storage to deny a running executable from unlinking itself.
