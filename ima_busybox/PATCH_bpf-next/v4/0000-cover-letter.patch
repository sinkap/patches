Subject: [PATCH bpf-next v4 0/4] Fixes for ima selftest

# v3 -> v4

* Fix typos.
* Update commit message for the indentation patch.
* Added Andrii's acks.

# v2 -> v3

* Added missing tags.
* Indentation fixes + some other fixes suggested by Andrii.
* Re-indent file to tabs.

The selftest for the bpf_ima_inode_hash helper uses a shell script to
setup the system for ima. While this worked without an issue on recent
desktop distros, it failed on environments with stripped out shells like
busybox which is also used by the bpf CI.

This series fixes the assumptions made on the availablity of certain
command line switches and the expectation that securityfs being mounted
by default.

It also adds the missing kernel config dependencies in
tools/testing/selftests/bpf and, lastly, changes the indentation of
ima_setup.sh to use tabs.

KP Singh (4):
  selftests/bpf: Update ima_setup.sh for busybox
  selftests/bpf: Ensure securityfs mount before writing ima policy
  selftests/bpf: Add config dependency on BLK_DEV_LOOP
  selftests/bpf: Indent ima_setup.sh with tabs.
