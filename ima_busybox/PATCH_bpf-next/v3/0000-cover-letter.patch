Subject: [PATCH bpf-next v3 0/4] Fixes for ima selftest

# v3 -> v3

# v2 -> v3

* Added missing tags.
* Indentation fixes + some other fixes suggested by Andrii.
* Re-indent file to tabs.


The selftest for bpf_ima_inode_hash helper uses a shell script for setup
the system for ima policy. While this ran without an issue on a recent
Debian and Ubuntu desktop distros, it failed on environments with
stripped out shells like busybox.

This series fixes some of the assumptions made on the availablity of
certain command line switches, file systems being mounted by default and
adds the missing kernel config dependencies in
tools/testing/selftests/bpf.


KP Singh (4):
  selftests/bpf: Update ima_setup.sh for busybox
  selftests/bpf: Ensure securityfs mount before writing ima policy
  selftests/bpf: Add config dependency on BLK_DEV_LOOP
  selftests/bpf: Indent ima_setup.sh with tabs.
