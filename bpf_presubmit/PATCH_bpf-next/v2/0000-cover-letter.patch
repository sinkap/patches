Subject: [PATCH bpf-next v2 0/2] BPF selftest helper script

# v1 -> v2

- The script now compiles the kernel by default, and the -k option
  implies "keep the kernel"
- Pointer to the script in the docs.
- Some minor simplifications.

Allow developers and contributors to understand if their changes would
end up breaking the BPF CI and avoid the back and forth required for
fixing the test cases in the CI environment. The series also adds a
pointer in tools/testing/selftests/bpf/README.rst.

  bpf: Helper script for running BPF presubmit tests
  bpf/selftests: Add a short note about run_in_vm.sh in README.rst
