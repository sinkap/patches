Subject: [PATCH bpf-next v4 0/2] BPF selftest helper script

# v3 -> v4

- Fix logic for updating kernel config to not download the file
  if there are no upstream modifications and avoid extraneous
  kernel compilation as suggested by Andrii.
- This also removes the need for the -k flag.

# v2 -> v3

- Fixes to silence verbose commands
- Fixed output buffering without being teed out
- Fixed the clobbered error code of the script
- Other fixes suggested by Andrii

# v1 -> v2

- The script now compiles the kernel by default, and the -k option
  implies "keep the kernel"
- Pointer to the script in the docs.
- Some minor simplifications.

Allow developers and contributors to understand if their changes would
end up breaking the BPF CI and avoid the back and forth required for
fixing the test cases in the CI environment. The series also adds a
pointer in tools/testing/selftests/bpf/README.rst.
