+==========================
+eBPF Linux Security Module
+==========================
+
+This LSM allows runtime instrumentation of the LSM hooks by privileged users to
+implement system-wide MAC (Mandatory Access Control) and Audit policies using
+eBPF. The LSM is privileged and stackable and requires both ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN``
+and ``CAP_MAC_ADMIN`` for the loading of BPF programs and modification of MAC
+policies respectively.
+
+eBPF Programs
+==============
+
+`eBPF (extended BPF) <https://cilium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bpf>`_ is a
+virtual machine-like construct in the Linux Kernel allowing the execution of
+verifiable, just-in-time compiled byte code at various points in the Kernel.
+
+The eBPF LSM adds a new type, ``BPF_PROG_TYPE_LSM``, of eBPF programs which
+have the following characteristics:
+
+	* Multiple eBPF programs can be attached to the same LSM hook
+	* The programs are always run after the static hooks (i.e. the ones
+	  registered by SELinux, AppArmor, Smack etc.)
+	* LSM hooks can return an ``-EPERM`` to indicate the decision of the
+	  MAC policy being enforced or simply be used for auditing
+	* If ``CONFIG_SECURITY_BPF_ENFORCE`` is enabled and a non-zero error
+	  code is returned from the BPF program, no further BPF programs for the hook are executed
+	* Allowing the eBPF programs to be attached to all the LSM hooks by
+	  making :doc:`/bpf/btf` type information available for all LSM hooks
+	  and allowing the BPF verifier to perform runtime relocations and
+	  validation on the programs
+
+Structure
+---------
+
+The example shows an eBPF program that can be attached to the ``file_mprotect``
+LSM hook:
+
+.. c:function:: int file_mprotect(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long reqprot, unsigned long prot);
+
+eBPF programs that use :doc:`/bpf/btf` do not need to include kernel headers
+for accessing information from the attached eBPF program's context. They can
+simply declare the structures in the eBPF program and only specify the fields
+that need to be accessed.
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+	struct mm_struct {
+		unsigned long start_brk, brk, start_stack;
+	} __attribute__((preserve_access_index));
+
+	struct vm_area_struct {
+		unsigned long start_brk, brk, start_stack;
+		unsigned long vm_start, vm_end;
+		struct mm_struct *vm_mm;
+	} __attribute__((preserve_access_index));
+
+
+.. note:: Only the size and the names of the fields must match the type in the
+	  kernel and the order of the fields is irrelevant.
+
+The eBPF programs can be declared using macros similar to the ``BPF_TRACE_<N>``
+macros defined in `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/bpf_trace_helpers.h`_. In this
+example:
+
+	* The LSM hook takes 3 args so we use ``BPF_TRACE_3``
+	* ``"lsm/file_mprotect"`` indicates the LSM hook that the program must
+	  be attached to
+	* ``mprotect_audit`` is the name of the eBPF program
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+        SEC("lsm/file_mprotect")
+        int BPF_PROG(mprotect_audit, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
+                     unsigned long reqprot, unsigned long prot)
+	{
+		int is_heap;
+
+		is_heap = (vma->vm_start >= vma->vm_mm->start_brk &&
+			   vma->vm_end <= vma->vm_mm->brk);
+
+		/*
+		 * Return an -EPERM or write information to the perf events buffer
+		 * for auditing
+		 */
+	}
+
+The ``__attribute__((preserve_access_index))`` is a clang feature that allows
+the BPF verifier to update the offsets for the access at runtime using the
+:doc:`/bpf/btf` information. Since the BPF verifier is aware of the types, it
+also validates all the accesses made to the various types in the eBPF program.
+
+Loading
+-------
+
+eBPP programs can be loaded with the :manpage:`bpf(2)` syscall's
+``BPF_PROG_LOAD`` operation or more simply by using the the libbpf helper
+``bpf_prog_load_xattr``:
+
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+	struct bpf_prog_load_attr attr = {
+		.file = "./prog.o",
+	};
+	struct bpf_object *prog_obj;
+	struct bpf_program *prog;
+	int prog_fd;
+
+	bpf_prog_load_xattr(&attr, &prog_obj, &prog_fd);
+
+Attachment to LSM Hooks
+-----------------------
+
+The LSM allows attachment of eBPF programs as LSM hooks using :manpage:`bpf(2)`
+syscall's ``BPF_PROG_ATTACH`` operation or more simply by
+using the libbpf helper ``bpf_program__attach_lsm``. In the code shown below
+``prog`` is the eBPF program loaded using ``BPF_PROG_LOAD``:
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+	struct bpf_link *link;
+
+	link = bpf_program__attach_lsm(prog);
+
+The program can be detached from the LSM hook by *destroying* the ``link``
+link returned by ``bpf_program__attach_lsm``:
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+	link->destroy();
+
+Examples
+--------
+
+An example eBPF program can be found in
+`tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/lsm_mprotect_audit.c`_ and the corresponding
+userspace code in
+`tools/testing/selftests/bpf/prog_tests/lsm_mprotect_audit.c`_
